# Goal

In this project we have to analyze a dataset and do general data analysis by using : 

1. Numpy

2. Pandas

3. Matplotlib

4. Seaborn

It will be recommended to install Anaconda, which comes with all of the necessary packages.

# Dataset
I choose the TMDb movie data set for data analysis. This data set contains information of about 10,846 movies 
collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue. I would like to find other
intresting patterns in the dataset. This is done by using different 1d and 2d patterns .
It contains 21 different columns which includes
1. budget
2. popularity
3. revenue
4. directors
5. actors
and many more columns.


# Questions which i am going to investigate upon are:

# Research Questions:

Ques1: Movie which has high or lowest profit?

Ques2: Movie which has high or lowest budget?

Ques3: Movie that has longest or shortest run?

Ques4: Movie that highest or lowest revenue ?

Ques5: Year in which we had maximum number of profitable movies?

Ques6: Which is most successful genre?

Ques7: What is most frequent cast?

Ques8: What is average revenue throughout?

Ques9: What is average budget throughout?

Ques10: top 10 directors who had directed maximum number of movies?


# Conclusions :
By analysing the whole dataset I came through some conclusions:

Movie which has highest Profit throughout : Avatar.

Movie which has lowest Profit throughout : The Warrior's Way

Movie which has highest budget throughout : The Warrior's Way

Movie which has lowest budget throughout : Lost & Found

Director with maximum number of movie releases is : Steven Spielberg

Average revenue of the movies having profit above 40 million is: 235252091.12987012

Actor with highest number of movies releases : Robert De Niro


# Limitations:
The analysis which is being done has a approximate profit of 40 million and above.This may not be error free but

probability of the movie can be increased to become a hit and there is a possibility that the data may not be updated.

and there is no specific unit of currency depicted in the dataset so the profit can be high or low depending on the 

unit of currency in that particular country.
